Part 1- Singly Linked List.
The singly linked list is implemented in the SLL.cpp and SLL.h files. The SLL.h file has the declaration of the list functions and how to use them. The file named DataStruct.cpp has a main fuction that shows the operations
of the functions. There is also a print function that allows the user to see the contents of the list. The 3 included pictures that start with SLLpt contain the output of the main function. The main function further
breaks down what is being shown in comments.
Part 2- Stack
The stack is implemented in the stack.cpp and stack.h files. The stack.h file has the declarations of the stack functions and how to use them. The file named DataStructStack.cpp has a main function that shows the operations of the functions. There is also a print function that allows the user to see the contents of the stack. The picture named StackPic shows the output of the main function. The main function further breaks down the output 
in the comments.
