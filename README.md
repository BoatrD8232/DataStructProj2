Part 1- Singly Linked List

The singly linked list is implemented in the SLL.cpp and SLL.h files. The SLL.h file has the declaration of the list functions and how to use them. The file named DataStruct.cpp has a main fuction that shows the operations
of the functions. There is also a print function that allows the user to see the contents of the list. The 3 included pictures that start with SLLpt contain the output of the main function. The main function further
breaks down what is being shown in comments. Due to some difficulties I encounter with linking errors, the type of the template class must be decided and declared before running the program. You may change the type of the template class by replacing int on the final line of SLL.cpp with the desired type. The class may be used with any type, but the examples in main only use an int type.

This picture shows how pop reacts to an empty list, pushes an pops one item at a time, then fills and then empties the list

Refilling the list with push front, then inserting in various places. Lastly calling remove with an invalid index.

Part 2- Stack

The stack is implemented in the stack.cpp and stack.h files. The stack.h file has the declarations of the stack functions and how to use them. The file named DataStructStack.cpp has a main function that shows the operations of the functions. There is also a print function that allows the user to see the contents of the stack. The picture named StackPic shows the output of the main function. The main function further breaks down the output 
in the comments.
